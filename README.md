stb_image and stb_image_write
=============================

These two mini-libraries build directly into your app as source files. stb_image loads subsets of png, bmp, jpeg, tga, psd, gif, hdr, and pig files, and stb_image_write writes png, bmp, and tga files. Read the header files for more details.

I've uploaded them for my own convenience. Check the original location for updates: http://nothings.org/
